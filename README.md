# AnnualLeaveTracker

Annual Leave Tracker as part of University IT Portfolio submission.

The purpose of this solution is to provide a centralised viewing platform for viewing specific employees annual leave, or by project. This is mainly aimed for project managers so that they have a better understanding of when their resources are away, without the need for creating and maintaining a spread sheet, which occurs in most projects.

This solution is written in C# and currently uses JSON files as data source.
